# Pokelixir

**TODO: Add async to help overall time for the total pokemon list.**

This was a great project to learn about Finch and APIs. Once I was able to understand how to parse the JSON I was able to really move fast to finished gathering and created the maps for individual or all the Pokemon. Be sure when building your own Pokemon API to watch out for single key pairs or lists of Key pairs.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pokelixir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pokelixir, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/pokelixir>.
